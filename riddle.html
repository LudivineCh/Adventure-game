              <p>Thanks for saving me!!! Only a TRUE hero could have succeeded this epic quest !</p>
              <p>My brother Tezcatlipoca tried to kill me as I overthrow him in the past. Eventually, we cooperated to create the 5th sun, but he never forgave me for being so selfish.</p>
              <p>The prophety says that one day he will induce me to sin, drunkenness, and carnal love, thus putting an end to the Toltec golden age. His animal disguise is the Jaguar, so next time you see one in your dream, it will mean that he has succeeded.</p>
              <p>As a present, I will protect you the next time you need help. <br> To call me all you need to do is to whisper a special quote when the wind blows. </p>
