            <p>Dear precious human, I am  Ōmeteōtl, the primordial Aztec deity. I represent the duality in this world : creation and destruction, feminity and masculinity, good and evil, light and darkness. </p>
            <p>On this dark day, I desperately ask for your assistance. I can feel a terrible thing has happened to my son, Quetzalcoatl, the creator of this world and mankind. So, you should consider him as your father.</p>
            <p>The wind whispers that Quetzalcoatl is trapped in its temple waiting for one of its children to save its soul. From all our enemies, one must have decided to seek revenge.</p>
            <p>Please make your choice wisely, for it will dominate your destiny.</p>
